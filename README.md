This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in Python programs. The `bug.py` file shows code that can trigger these errors. The `bugSolution.py` file (in a separate commit) provides examples of how to handle them using appropriate error handling techniques.  The errors demonstrated are:

*   **ZeroDivisionError:** Occurs when dividing by zero.
*   **RecursionError:** Caused by excessively deep recursion.
*   **UnicodeDecodeError:** When a file is opened with an incorrect encoding.
